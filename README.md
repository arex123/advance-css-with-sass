  ## keyFrames , Transfomr, move texts like animation in horizontal manner

below code applies for a text to animate it to move from:<br><br>
 left(-100px) position to original position to 10px right position

 and in start of page loading its opacity will be 0 then after animation its opacity will be 1(visible)

    @keyframes moveTextToLeft{
    0%{
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateX(-100px);
    }

    80%{
        transform:translate(10px)
    }

    100%{
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
    }

To use above code we will add its name(moveTextToLeft) to that element in css


    .heading-primary-main{
        font-size: 60px;
        font-weight: 400;
        letter-spacing: 35px;
        
        animation-name: moveTextToLeft;
        animation-duration:1s;
    }



    animation-timing-function: ease-out; 


    animation-delay: 3s; /* this will start animation after 3 seconds*/
    animation-iteration-count: 2; /*number of times animation happens*/
